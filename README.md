# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

Contents
CodeBook.md - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
run_analysis.R - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
run_data_summary.txt - Output file generated by the run_analysis.R script.
README.md - This file.
Getting started
Read through the CodeBook and the run_analysis.R script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file.
Make sure the experiment data is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called UCI HAR Dataset.
Run the run_analysis.R script.
